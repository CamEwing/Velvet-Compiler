Velvet is an all-purpose language with an emphasis on ‘Keeping It Simple Student’. We have created this language
to be easy for beginner programmers to learn, using simple and straightforward syntax while maintaining the basic 
principles of programming. We made the following changes to our language in order to reinforce the KISS philosophy:

- Comments can now read most ASCII characters (as opposed to only reading letters, numbers and whitespace).
- Added new keywords for logical operations (AND, OR).
- Added ART_OP_T to act as a single token for all arithmetic operations.
- Added REL_OP_T to act as a single token for all relational operations (we are also adding equal-to (or '==') to the relational operators).
