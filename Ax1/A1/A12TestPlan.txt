The batch can be run from the command line by simply navigating to the A12/out/x64-debug folder and
typing A12.bat into the command line.

In order to run the executable, navigate to the same folder as above A12/out/x64-debug. Typing into
the command line the following format: Velvet.exe {R/S/P} {input file} {mode} {size} {increment}
 
Reader:
Velvet.exe R {input file} {mode} {size} {increment}

Velvet.exe:	Calls the executable file for the compiler.
R/S/P:		R = Reader, S = Scanner, P = Parser, The options for different stages of the compiler.
Input File:	The file to be compiled.
Mode:		F = Fixed, A = Addit, M = Multi, The reader mode for incrementing the buffer size.
Size:		Manually enter the starting size of the buffer.
Increment:	Manually choose the constant increment of the buffer.

Example:	Velvet.exe R README.txt A 100 10

Scanner:
Velvet.exe S {input file}
